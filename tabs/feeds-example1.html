  <p>This is an example of an api.js handling of a RESTful api call, expecting <span>apiurl/APIKEY/feed/9/articles/101</span> would result it get_feeds_id_articles_id for feed_id: 9 and article_id: 101 using the given APIKEY for validation, it also uses the httpMethod for get / post / put / delete etc.</p>
  <p>After building the request name it would then search in side /requests directory for a request of that name and return the result of calling that request.</p>
